# C_snake_game
Simple snake game built with C

Requirements: GCC compiler, ncurses library

This is my first completed original C project. For that matter, it's my first ever completed personal project - as in, not something prompted 
or guided by an academic course or resource.

To complete it I had to learn some basics of the ncurses library in addition to a few other things not covered in Harvard's CS50 course (mainly switch
and goto statements).
